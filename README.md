Health Risk Assessment & Activity Recognition Model
A machine learning-based system for predicting health risks and classifying human activities. The project includes two models:

Health Risk Assessment Model (91% accuracy)
Activity Recognition Model (85% accuracy)
Both models are deployed via a Flask API, enabling real-time predictions.

Features

Predicts health risks using biometric data (BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
Recognizes human activities based on sensor data
Flask-based REST API for real-time predictions
Preprocessing with one-hot encoding and feature scaling
Trained on a dataset of over 10,000 samples

Tech Stack

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
Web Framework: Flask
Deployment: REST API
